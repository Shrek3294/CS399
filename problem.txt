Problem Statement 5: Student Engagement and Retention in a University Program
Organization (fictitious): Northview University – Student Success Office
Industry Vertical: Higher Education / Student Services
Problem Description: The Student Success Office at Northview University supports thousands
of undergraduates through advising, tutoring, and co-curricular programs. Despite many
available resources, student engagement is uneven, and early signs of disengagement often
go unnoticed until academic performance declines. Advisors rely on manual tracking and
fragmented systems, making it difficult to proactively support students at risk. The office seeks
a more systematic and scalable approach to monitoring engagement while respecting student
autonomy.
Potential Software Solution (Outline): A student engagement monitoring and support tool
that integrates academic signals, participation data, and self-reported inputs. The software
could use AI to flag risk patterns, recommend targeted interventions, and provide students
with personalized nudges and resources through a user-friendly interface.
Persona: Laura Martinez
Role: Academic Advisor
Background: Master’s in Higher Education Administration
Context & Motivation: Laura supports hundreds of students and worries she only learns about
problems when it’s too late. She wants early signals of disengagement and practical tools to
intervene constructively, without feeling like she is surveilling students or overwhelming them
with messages.
